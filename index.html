    <h2>Starting Over</h2>
    <p>Hey how you doing? Welcome to my own personal dev blog. This was long overdue as I started trying to learn
        how to design websites a couple years ago but I eventually put it down to pursue other things. Life kinda
        throws these different pathways and skills for you to learn and walk on but unfortunately I did not choose web design
        as one of those. Who knows where I could have been now if I chose to work on it then.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, I decided to dust off the old C drive on my laptop and saw some unfinished websites and remembered that
        I took a course on webdesign that I have not finished. I thought about it and figured what if I take the course all the way to the end?
        So now I'm starting my web development journey from scratch just to see how much I remember. It's gonna be long and messy
        but hopefully I can make something out of this by the end of this year.
    </p>
    <p>Keep track of this Date: May 16, 2024.
        This is where it all began (again)
    </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Other than just starting this on a complete whim, I had some inspirations to hopefully
        keep me going. Im not sure if this is too cliche or personal but eh whatever its my own blog anyways.
        I recently went through a break up of a 4 year long relationship and it hurts quite a bit hahaha. Even though it ended with both of us not resenting each other.
        She needed some space to for herself and as much as I wanted to keep trying and keep her happy in our relationship,
        I respected her decision as she clearly made up her mind. Now I'm just looking for things to do and improve on myself.
    </p>
    <p>I started setting more goals for my own self improvement not only for web development.
        This is what I got so far:

        <ul>
            <li>Complete Web Development Bootcamp (of course)</li>
            <li>Get to benchpressing a plate at the gym (Where at 32.5 lbs we're almost there!)</li>
            <li>Save up for a car (Preferably a beautiful gr86 but if not possible just any car to get me around is fine)</li>
            <li>Learn SQL for any future projects</li>
            <li>Get better at data structures and algorithms. This is a must by the end of summer!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>These projects are not related to web development at all.... For now anyways hahaha.
        These are all of those different skills and pathways that I was talking about before.
        Most of them are short and unfinished games but I'm proud of them. Hopefully in the future after
        I prioritize learning my shorterm goals skillset I can work on and finish a game that is succesful and proud of.
